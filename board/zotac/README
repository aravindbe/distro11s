PROVISIONING A ZOTAC
####################

The recommended way to bring up a Zotac board is to use the usb installer for
distro11s.  Here's how:

0. meshkit is the mesh network manager that runs by default on distro11s/zotac.
   See board/zotac/overlay/etc/meshkit/meshkit.default.conf for the default
   meshkit configuration, and packages/meshkit/meshkit.sample.conf for the
   documentation of the meshkit config variables.  If you want to use a
   different configuration than the one provided in
   board/zotac/overlay/etc/meshkit/meshkit.default.conf, copy that file
   somewhere (e.g., ./mymeshkit.conf) and alter it.

1. Prepare a config file.  Consider setting DISTRO11S_STATIC_IFACE and
   DISTRO11S_HOSTNAME to personalized values to differentiate your zotac nodes
   from those of your co-developers.  If you created a customized meshkit
   config file in step 0, be sure to set DISTRO11S_MESHKIT_CONFIG to point to
   the config file (e.g., $PWD/mymeshkit.conf).  Alternatively, if you are
   using a binary release and wish to use the default settings, set:

   export DISTRO11S_CONF=$PWD/board/zotac/distro11s-release.conf

2. Build distro11s for zotac as described in the top-level README.  However, if
   you are using a binary release, you may skip this step.

3. Create a distro11s provisioning USB drive as described in the top-level
   README:

   $ ./scripts/provisioning.sh -d /dev/sdX -i

   Naturally, you must change sdX to match your USB drive.

4. Plug the provisioning USB drive into the zotac and boot it from USB.  To
   achieve this, you must hit F11 at boot time and select the USB drive from
   the list of boot devices.  The provisioning process will happen
   automatically.  Unfortunately, there is no convenient way to know when the
   provisioning has completed if there is not a monitor.  If you have
   configured a static IP address scheme, you can attempt to ping that IP
   address.  Once this succeeds, you can expect that your zotac no longer needs
   its USB drive attached and that provisioning succeeded.

5. You can now proceed to provision the next zotac.  It will have an
   incremented hostname (e.g., zotac-2) and IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.192).

6. Expect the zotacs to all come up and form a mesh network as specified by
   your meshkit config.
