PROVISIONING A ZOTAC
####################

The recommended way to bring up a Zotac board is to use the usb installer for
distro11s.  Here's how:

0. Build distro11s for zotac as described in the top-level README

1. Create a distro11s provisioning USB drive as described in the top-level
   README:

   $ ./scripts/provisioning.sh -d /dev/sdX -i

   Naturally, you must change sdX to match your USB drive.
