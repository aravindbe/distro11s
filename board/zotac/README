PROVISIONING A ZOTAC
####################

The recommended way to bring up a Zotac board is to use the usb installer for
distro11s.  Here's how:

0. Prepare a config file.  Consider using the
   DISTRO11S_AUTO_INCREMENT_INSTALLER and DISTRO11S_STATIC_IFACE feature to
   differentiate the IP addresses and hostnames of your zotac nodes.
   Alternatively, if you are using a binary release:

   export DISTRO11S_CONF=$PWD/board/zotac/distro11s-release.conf

1. Build distro11s for zotac as described in the top-level README.  However, if
   you are using a binary release, you may skip this step.

2. Create a distro11s provisioning USB drive as described in the top-level
   README:

   $ ./scripts/provisioning.sh -d /dev/sdX -i

   Naturally, you must change sdX to match your USB drive.

3. Plug the provisioning USB drive into the zotac and boot it from USB.  To
   achieve this, you must hit F11 at boot time and select the USB drive from
   the list of boot devices.  The provisioning process will happen
   automatically.  Unfortunately, there is no convenient way to know when the
   provisioning has completed if there is not a monitor.  If you have
   configured a static IP address scheme, you can attempt to ping that IP
   address.  Once this succeeds, you can expect that your zotac no longer needs
   its USB drive attached and that provisioning succeeded.
