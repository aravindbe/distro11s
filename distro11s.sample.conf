# do you want the board to know about your development host?  Some boards
# (e.g., qemu) will use this to automount an sshfs from your dev machine at
# boot time.
DISTRO11S_HOST_IP=192.168.55.1

# address, you can set it here.  If not, set DISTRO_STATIC_IFACE="" and the
# other STATIC variables will be ignored.

# The target can auto mount a directory over sshfs if you like.  This is
# convenient for sharing files between your host and target.  If you want to
# use this feature, set this variable to the directory on your host that you
# would like to share.  Expect the files in /mnt on the qemu target.  Note that
# a ssh key without a passphrase will be generated and installed in ~/.ssh on
# your host to achieve this.
#
# NOTE: THIS FEATURE INTRODUCES SECURITY RISKS BOTH ON YOUR DEV MACHINE AND ON
# THE TARGET BOARD.  IT IS MEANT FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY, NOT FOR PRODUCTION.
