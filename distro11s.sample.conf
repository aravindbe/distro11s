# These configuration variables influence various distro11s build properties

# Target board
DISTRO11S_BOARD=qemu

# Location where source should be checked out
DISTRO11S_SRC=${PWD}/src

# Location where output (e.g., binaries, images, etc.) should be written

# do you want the board to know about your development host?  Some boards
# (e.g., qemu) will use this to automount an sshfs from your dev machine at
# boot time.
DISTRO11S_HOST_IP=192.168.55.1

# This is the hostname that will be set for the target board.  By default, it
# will be the board name.  But if you work in an environment with lots of other
# mesh developers, this can get confusing.  So you might want to make it
# something like ${DISTRO11S_BOARD}-${USR}.  Note that the value that you
# configure here will be appended with the host number in
# /etc/distro11s-hostnumber if that file exists.  For example, if you set
# DISTRO11S_HOSTNAME to foobar, then deploy your distro11s build on two nodes
# with /etc/distro11s-hostnumber = 0 and 1, the nodes will assign themselves
# the names foobar-0 and foobar-1 respectively.
DISTRO11S_HOSTNAME=${DISTRO11S_BOARD}

# static IP configuration: If you would like the board to have a static IP
# address, you can set it here.  If not, set DISTRO_STATIC_IFACE="" and the
# other STATIC variables will be ignored.
#
# Note that if /etc/distro11s-hostnumber exists, the value in this file will be
# added to the static IP in order to differentiate various hosts.  For example,
# if you have two nodes whose /etc/distro11s-hostnumber is set to 3 and 4
# respectively, and DISTRO11S_STATIC_IP is 192.168.99.100, the first node will
# end up with IP address 192.168.99.103, and the second will have
# 192.168.99.104.

# The target can auto mount a directory over sshfs if you like.  This is
# convenient for sharing files between your host and target.  If you want to
# use this feature, set this variable to the directory on your host that you
# would like to share.  Expect the files in /mnt on the qemu target.  Note that
# a ssh key without a passphrase will be generated and installed in ~/.ssh on
# your host to achieve this.
#
# NOTE: THIS FEATURE INTRODUCES SECURITY RISKS BOTH ON YOUR DEV MACHINE AND ON
# THE TARGET BOARD.  IT IS MEANT FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY, NOT FOR PRODUCTION.
