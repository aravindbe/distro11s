INTRODUCTION
############

distro11s is a quick and dirty ephemeral roll-your-own linux distribution based
on Debian that adds packages and a suitable kernel to play with mesh
networking.  It is "ephemeral" because all of the work is meant to be pushed
upstream regularly.  So most folks who want to use mesh will pull their code
from upstream, not from us.  But we need a coherent way to track and test the
latest and greatest.  This document explains all the steps needed to build
distro11s.  For details on the supported target boards, see the README files in
the board/ directory.

SETTING UP YOUR DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM
##################################

We build distro11s on Ubuntu 11.04.  Here's how:

1. Intall the packages that you'll need to build the distro.  Note that this
   list of packages is what's required to build all packages for any
   conceivable board.

   $ apt-get install python-dev uml-utilities

   $ wget -O /usr/share/qemu/pxe-rtl8139.bin \
     http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/trunk/pc-bios/pxe-rtl8139.bin?root=qemu
   $ wget -O /usr/share/qemu/pxe-e1000.bin \
     http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/trunk/pc-bios/pxe-e1000.bin?root=qemu

2. Create a configuration file for your build.  This is just a bunch of bash
   variables that influence the build.  The recommended way to create a config
   file is to copy distro11s.sample.conf to distro11s.conf and edit it.  It's
   loaded with comments, so read it for more details.

FETCHING THE CODE
#################

This is a distribution.  Accordingly, it is made up of many packages.  To fetch
all of the packages into your $DISTRO11S_SRC directory, say:

$ ./scripts/fetch.sh

BUILDING THE CODE
#################

To build all of the packages, say:

$ ./scripts/build.sh

Note that most targets use debbootstrap to prepare the basic rootfs and must be
built as root.  You will be warned if/when this happens.

ADDING A NEW SUPPORTED BOARD
############################

Create a directory in board/ with the name of your board.  Consider cloning the
board directory for a similar target.  Note the board/<board>/<board>.conf
file.  It contains board-specific overrides that can be used to tweak the
build.

TIPS AND TRICKS
###############

-- Many parts of the distro11s build system use stamp files in the
   out/<board>/stamps/ directory.  This way, scripts can be run multiple times
   without repeating very time-consuming steps that might be unnecessary.  To
   force various parts of the build to execute again, delete the appropriate
   stamp file.  Inspect the contents in the stamps directory for more details.

-- The stamp system is not very sophisticated at this time.  It's mostly used
   for the release procedure, which is a complete clean build.  As you develop,
   you may find it easier to hop around the DISTRO11S_SRC directory manually
   invoking make/make install (or whatever).

-- Avoid using sudo.  But if you must (e.g., mount, debootstrap, etc.), use the
   root_check function before invoking sudo.  This alerts the user.
