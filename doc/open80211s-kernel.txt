Introduction
============

The kernel where we develop open80211s lives here:

git@github.com:cozybit/open80211s.git

This tree is meant to track the wireless-testing tree closely, which is available here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git

We want to make releases from the open80211s tree that contains our development
patches.  Generally, these patches will have been submitted, but perhaps not
accepted.  Accordingly, the patches are subject to revision and will have to be
updated.  This document describes how we set up the open80211s tree to do this,
and how the development cycle works.

This practice can be applied to other trees as needed.  For example, if we
start to have a long list of wpa_supplicant patches that are under review but
not committed upstream yet, consider setting up a forked wpa_supplicant tree
and applying a similar technique to the one described here.

Setting up the tree
===================

Development bound for distro11s happens on the distro11s-dev branch.  You, the
distro11s maintainer, are the only one who messes with this branch.  Start by
creating it:

   $ cd some/kernel/git/tree/ # possibly ${DISTRO11S_SRC}/kernel
   $ git remote add wt git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git
   $ git fetch wt master:wt
   $ git remote add o11s git@github.com:cozybit/open80211s.git
   $ git push o11s +wt:distro11s-dev
   $ git fetch o11s distro11s-dev:distro11s-dev

Now, you must redirect distro11s to build the o11s tree instead of the upstream
tree.  To do this, alter board/<board>/pkglist.  You probably have to rm -rf
${DISTRO11S_SRC}/kernel and run distro11s/scripts/fetch.sh to get the new
kernel in place.  distro11s is not clever enough to just fetch a branch.

Okay.  Now your working copy has a distro11s-dev branch.  You (the distro11s
maintainer) will periodically rebase this branch to wt HEAD and push -f to
o11s.  Read on for more details on how this works.

Fetching Patches
================

You need a way to fetch raw patches submitted by developers.  There are a few
ways to do this.  I use distro11s/hosttools/getpatch.py to pull them from my
email account.  Anyway, before you can properly manage distro11s using the
techniques described here, you should have a favorite way of fetching patches.

The development cycle
=====================

0. It's Monday.  The top of a development cycle.  You, the distro11s
   maintainer, are preparing the next release of distro11s.  You start by
   rebasing the open80211s tree's distro11s-dev branch to wireless testing
   HEAD:

   $ cd $DITRO11S_SRC/kernel/
   $ git fetch wt master:wt
   $ git rebase wt distro11s-dev
   [ resolve any conflicts ]


1. Bob is a open80211s developer.  Last week he submitted a patchset containing
   3 patches that support the "next big thing" (nbt) and submits them to
   linux-wireless mailing list.  He expects these patches to go in the next
   distro11s release, so he --bcc's distro11s@cozybit.com.
   
   
2. There are two different process to get andapply Bob's patches:

   2.1 MAILINGN LIST
   -----------------

   You fetch these patches into your kernel directory.  Let's call the patches 1.patch,
   2.patch, and 3.patch.

   Apply Bob's patches:

   $ git am 1.patch 2.patch 3.patch

   You might get some conflicts here depending on what has happend in the
   wireless testing tree.  If this happens, you can either resolve the
   conflicts yourself, or ask Bob to rebase his patches to wireless-testing
   HEAD and resubmit to distro11s@cozybit.com.

   This approach is very useful if Bob is a developer located somewhere in the universe

   2.2 FETCHING THE DEVELOPER's PATCH BRANCH
   -----------------------------------------

   In this approach, Bob has two different branches available in his working directory:

     - Development branch: this is the branch where Bob uses to do all the
       magic in form of patches.

     - Patch branch: in this branch, Bob applies all the patches he wrote, but
       only after submitting them to distro11s/wireless-testing. 
       
       Also, Bob makes sure that this branch is syncronized with the wireless
       testing branch and his patches can be applied without any issues. He is
       responsable to rebase it.
       
       The name of this branch is up to the developer, but it's recommended to
       use the convention <developername>-patches.

   The release manager has to fetch Bob's Patch branch in order to get the last
   version of all the patches that bob submitted. The process is this:
    
   $ git remote bob ssh://<usename>@<hostname/IP>/path/to/the/git/repo
   $ git fetch bob bob-patches:bob-patches
   $ git log
   Check the commit ids of Bob's patches on top of the last WT commit
   $ git cherrypick <commitid>

   This approach is very useful if the developers are in close communication
   with the release manager, both make sure that the patch branch is updated

 
3. Repeat the step 1-2 for Alice's patches and the patches from any other
   developers.

4. Push to o11s:

   $ git push o11s +distro11s-dev:distro11s-dev

   This forces the distro11s-dev remote branch to look just like yours.

5. Okay.  It's Friday.  Spin and test the release.  After you are happy with
   the release, you must make tag the tree.

   TODO: This should be handled automatically by the release script somehow

6. It's Monday again.  Since the last week, Alice's patches were accepted
   upstream.  Bob's patches sustained some comments and he submitted some V2
   patches that have not been accepted yet.  Repeat step 0 above.  This time,
   Alice's patches should be swallowed up in the mainline by the rebase.  Bob's
   V1 patches will remain at the top of the distro11s-dev branch.

7. Fetch Bob's V2 patch set (from the mailing list or from bob's patch branch)
   and use your git skills to replace Bob's V1 patches with his V2 patches.  I
   like git rebase -i to eliminate Bob's V1 patches and just git am to apply his
   V2 patches.  After this step, push to o11s as in step 4.

8. Repeat steps 1-5 to capture any new developments and spin the next release.
